## About

I'm Sundip Desai and I'm an engineering professional that has resided in the Bay Area for 12+ years.

I studied aerospace engineering at Cal Poly Pomona where my interests were in control systems. My graduate studies were done at the University of Southern California where I focused on aerospace controls and state estimation.

I'm passionate about learning beyond what I studied at school. My current interests are in machine learning/AI, statistical inference, algorithm development, data science, signal processing, robotics and a whole lot more!

I enjoy music, playing drums, reading and watching sports.

## Why

The purpose of this blog is to learn by sharing. In this blog you'll find small projects that helped me understand complex principles, musings on academia and on being a professional in Silicon Valley and insights and intuition behind a variety of technical subjects that interest me.
